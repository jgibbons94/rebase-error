This repository has a large commit I want to divide into atomic commits.
The definitions for functions a(), b(), c(), and d() should be divided.
I try to follow the instructions on Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/a/43138338
When I am rebasing and call "git reset HEAD~", git add -p says there is no commit.
However, git status lists the file as changed.
Search engines are unhelpful in this situation. All I get about this is unrelated to
git rebase or git add -p.
All help is appreciated.
